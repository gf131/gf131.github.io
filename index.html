					change the div class to six columns for both columns in the same row if I wanted 
					them to be equal in size. The only issue I had with working with skeleton for the
					first time was the fact that I couldn't figure out how to set a border with the
					div class container. It wasn't working for me for some reason. It's an error on my 
					end."</p>

					fixing my code because it does not come out the exact way I expected the first couple times."</p>
